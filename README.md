# Random-Maze-Generator

This is a simple web application that generates random, solvable mazes using Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `maze.html` file in your web browser.
3. Click the "Generate New Maze" button to generate a new maze.

## Dependencies

- This project uses basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No additional libraries or dependencies are required.

## How It Works

- The maze is generated using a Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm.
- Each cell of the maze has walls on all four sides initially.
- The algorithm removes walls between cells to create a solvable maze.
- The canvas element is used to draw the maze on the web page.
